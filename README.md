# Single linked list

The simple chained list is one of the most common and most widely used dynamic data structures.It is characterised by the fact that data is stored in a list which can be traversed (=iterated) "in one direction".Each element in the list - also referred to as a node - "knows" its direct successor node. To access the list, only a reference to the first element is stored. This first element is often referred to as the head of the list.
